In Tree.py

1. .__init__
   I suggest that only _link and _unlink change parent and children
   attributes.  This way there is less chance that the structure will
   be broken. We only have to make sure that _link and _unlink are correct.

2. ._smallest_leaf_name and .first_leaf 
   What is the difference? They seem to be identical. Since I don't
   know which you used i didn't remove. Please get rid of one of them.

3. ._check_height
   I changed to normal method, which could be overloaded in MetricTree.
   
   x._check_height_and_type(y) check types in CombinatorialTree
     and check types and heights in MetricTree 

   I think it is more elegant and readable.

4. .insert
   Since all the checks are happening at ._link, I removed them from insert.

5. .copy

   To make things more elegant, I added height argument in CombTree
   init, which is ignored.

6. .common_ancestor 
   Does go up from self? We need to discuss.

7. __str__
   changed pexp...string to str(pexp) which calls __str__ method of pexp

8. .__eq__
   if both are leaves you have to check names!

9. FromPexp
   I edited a bit. Not sure, it become better.

MetricTree

10. .__init__
    see edits. 

11. .is_leaf
    no need to overload

12. FromDistMatr
    Why do you multiply by 1 when building T from the first two leaves
    and elsewhere?
    Did you check it carefully?
